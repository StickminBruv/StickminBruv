Hey there, I'm g_r_e_y_. I don't really know a lot about coding but I think I use this account for monkeytype and cookie clicker. I play Minecraft and Roblox (cringe), and I only know some basic Lua, if that's a thing here.
Not much to see on this account but I can learn coding if I get interested enough. Currently working on a roblox game called INTERSTATE, so yeah I guess that's somewhat related. I type fast too so that might be good for coding
Is github all about coding and stuff? I have no clue whatsoeverr.
